# csgo-configs
A collection of CS:GO config files, commands, maps and useful info for either running things locally or on the Sølvguttene scrim server.

## Fungames configs
Check [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/rugern/csgo-configs/blob/main/cfg/fungames/SUMMARY.md) for an overview of configs
and commands for different fun game modes. These range from flavors of competitive play to entirely different games.

## Plugin commands
Check [plugins README.md](https://github.com/rugern/csgo-configs/blob/main/plugins/README.md) for an overview of
useful commands for the Sølvguttene scrim server running splewis/csgo-pug-setup and sethealth plugin

## Collection of fun workshop maps
The following collection is automatically downloaded on the scrim server: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2600005602
They do not automatically show up in map votes and map menus, but you can change to any map manually with e.g. `sm_map <map name>` as long as it's downloaded.
